<h2>Why AMD?</h2>
<span class="span-1">
Differentiation of matrix functions is still not well understood.  There is no 
"simple calculus" for computing matrix derivatives and therefore calculating 
matrix derivatives can be very time and memory consuming.  We want to build on 
known results to define a matrix-derivative calculus.
</span>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<span class="span-1">
The objective of AMD is to make matrix derivatives simple for both humans and 
computers.  We want symbolic differentiation to be simple and optimizing 
matrix-valued functions to be efficient in computation and storage.  AMD is 
an open-source C++ library to accomplish this.
</span>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<span class="span-1">
AMD can be used to optimize scalar-matrix functions.  Additionally, AMD can be 
used for:
<ul>
<li>Optimizing proximal gradient methods</li>
<li>Taylor expansions for sensitivity analysis</li>
<li>And more!</li>
</ul>
